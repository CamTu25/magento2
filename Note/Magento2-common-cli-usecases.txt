Notice:
Make sure your local environment env.php file is using 'developer' mode:
Locate app/etc/env.php & find 'MAGE_MODE' =>
`developer` mode will not need `setup:static-content:deploy`, all css, js, images, phtml, html & other static files are auto
generated.


Which command you should use in a specific case?

** bin/magento setup:upgrade
- Create a new module
- Define a new setup / upgrade / patch script or using db_schema.xml
- Modify .less file

** bin/magento setup:di:compile
- Adjust __construct function in class files
- Adjust di.xml files
We can also run short & quick term of remove generated code by run `rm -rf generated` at root directory of Magento,
it will remove generated code of dependencies injection. In `developer` mode, dependencies injection will be automated
generated when application run over. The `setup:di:compile` will generated all dependencies directly.

** bin/magento cache:clean
- Edit .css, phtml, .html files
- Change configurations in Admin
- Edit .php file that being called in templates (because templates are cached by full page cache, other .php files
won't need to run this.

** bin/magento cache:flush
- Same as cache:clean but with strong method and may affect other processes using the same cache storage.

** setup:static-content:deploy
- Edit translate files in i18n folder (usually .csv files)
